# Command Line LBM
This repository contains a C++ program that utilizes the standard C++ library to simulate simple fluid dynamics using the Lattice-Boltzmann Method.

The program is designed to plot results directly within the command-line interface using ANSI escape sequences. This feature ensures compatibility with tty environments, allowing for straightforward plotting.
